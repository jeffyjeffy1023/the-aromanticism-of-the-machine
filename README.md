## ABOUT

Simple userscript for Tampermonkey to replace "eroticism" with "aromanticism". Also of course editable to add other word replacements, but this is just a quick pre-setup script for this specifically because of this post:

Based on https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10976-replace-text-on-webpages/code. Have fun!

## HOW TO INSTALL
Click on "aromanticism.user.js" in the repository.

Then click on the little "raw" button at the top of the code viewer.

Your userscript manager should prompt the install, should be simple enough from there.
